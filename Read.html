            <h1>THE STORY</h1>
            <p>Eren and Ousman were stewards of a rich master. Some day accusations about Eren and Ousman were brought in that they were wasting their master's goods.</br>
                He called both stewards and asked them to account for their stewardship. Both stewards realized that their jobs were in danger.</br>
            </p> 
            <p>Both stewards formulated a plan. Eren called all of the master's debtors and asked them each how much they owed the master. He then asked each to reduce their quantity of debt quickly.</br>
                Meanwhile Ousman looked for someone to take the fall rather than himself.</br>
            </p>

            <p>When called back to the master for their stewardship accountability, the master commended the shrewdness of Eren and condemned Ousman for trying to deceive him.</br>
                Both still lost their stewardships but Eren fell into the favor he earned himself from the master's debtors. Ousman though was subjected to forced labour for his deceitful actions.
            </p>
            <h1>THE LESSON</h1>
            <p>MATTHEW 10:16</br>
                "Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be shrewd as serpents and harmless as doves."
            </p>
            <p>Jesus encourages us to be shrewd,wise and harmless in His ministry. Both deceitfulness and shrewdness have similarities, one of them being self preservation.</br>
                Being deceitful means to intentionally mislead or trick someone through dishonesty or cunning.</br>
                Being shrewd is to be sharp and clever. To be able to judge people's intentions and act accordingly.</br>
                As Jesus sent us out he asked us to be not only shrewd but harmless too. The lord hates lies. The moment your shrewdness invovles harming the other party through a lie or deception then it is no longer being shrewd but deceitful.</br>
                That is the main difference. Does your shrewdness harm someone? Then you are being deceit. And those who are deceit will be driven into forced labour.</br>
            </p>
            <p>PROVERBS 12:24</br>
                The hand of the diligent will rule, but slothfulness/deceitfulness will only lead to forced labour.</br>
                Be shrewd in His Kingdom and harmless as a dove. Do not deceive people for the LORD hates a lying tongue.</br>
                BE SHREWD soldier of Christ
